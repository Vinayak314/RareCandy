A. Balance Sheet Fundamentals (The "Health Check")
    1) Leverage Ratio:
        Formula: $\frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Equity}}$
        Logic: High leverage means a small drop in asset value wipes out the bank. If $L_B > 20x$, risk is high.
    2) Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):Formula: $\frac{\text{High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)}}{\text{Net Cash Outflows (30 days)}}$Logic: Can Bank B survive a 30-day run? If $LCR < 100\%$, they are desperate.
    3) Non-Performing Loan Ratio (NPL):Formula: $\frac{\text{Bad Loans}}{\text{Total Loans}}$Logic: Indicates the quality of Bank B's existing business.

B. Market Signals (The "Fear Gauge")
    4) CDS Spread ($S_B$):Data: The cost (in basis points) to insure against Bank B's default.Logic: A spike from 50bps to 200bps is a screaming warning signal.
    5) Stock Volatility ($\sigma_B$):Data: Standard deviation of Bank B's stock price over the last 10 days.Logic: High volatility implies uncertainty about the bank's true value.C. 

C. Network Position (The "Contagion Risk")
    6) Interbank Exposure ($E_{in}$):Data: Total amount Bank B has borrowed from other banks.Logic: If Bank B is already heavily in debt to others, Bank A shouldn't add more.
    7)Asset Correlation ($\rho_{AB}$):Data: Correlation between Bank A's assets and Bank B's assets.Logic: If both hold the same assets (e.g., tech stocks), a crash hurts both. Bank A should avoid lending to someone who gets sick at the same time.
