Phase 2: Network Reconstruction (The "Missing Link")Crucial Problem: Your dataset has Interbank_Assets and Interbank_Liabilities (totals), but it doesn't say who owes whom. You cannot simulate contagion without a network.Solution: Use the Maximum Entropy Method to probabilistically reconstruct the network matrix.If Bank A has high Interbank_Assets, and Bank B has high Interbank_Liabilities, the algorithm assumes a high probability of a loan between them.Result: A $50 \times 50$ matrix where cell $(i, j)$ represents the money Bank $i$ lent to Bank $j$.Phase 3: The Simulation Loop (Generating Training Data)Since actual bank crashes are rare, you must simulate millions of crash scenarios to train your ML model.The "Stress Test" Loop:Trigger a Shock: Drop the stock price of one bank (e.g., Bank #7) by 20%.Check Solvency:Update Bank #7's Equity: $Equity_{new} = Equity_{old} - Shock$.If $Equity_{new} < 0$, Bank #7 Defaults.Spread the Contagion (The Network Effect):Look at your Reconstructed Matrix. Who lent money to Bank #7?Let's say Bank #12 lent $1B to Bank #7.Bank #12 writes off that $1B. Its Assets drop by $1B.Recalculate: Does Bank #12's LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) drop below 100%? Does its Equity turn negative?If yes, Bank #12 defaults. Repeat.Record the Outcome:Input: The state of the market before the crash (Volatility, Leverage, etc.).Output (Y): The total financial loss ($) incurred by the CCP.Phase 4: The ML Model (The "Risk Engine")Now, train a model to predict the Potential Loss before it happens.Model Type: XGBoost Regressor (Excellent for tabular data) or Graph Neural Network (GNN) (if you want to capture the complex connections).Inputs (Features):Leverage_Ratio (from your sheet: Total_Assets / Equity)Liquidity_Buffer (from your sheet: HQLA / Net_Outflows_30d)Market_Volatility (from yfinance)CDS_Spread (from your sheet: Est_CDS_Spread - Highly predictive!)Network_Centrality (Calculated from your reconstructed matrix)Target (Label):Predicted_Systemic_Loss
